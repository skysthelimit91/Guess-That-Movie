# Project-1-Game-repo

This is the repository for my first GA project
Welcome to the "Guess That Movie" repo.

What the game is about:

This a video based trivia game. There are 13 questions in total. For each question, the player will be shown a video that lasts approximately 15 seconds. They will also be shown a corresponding answer set.

The player needs to select from the list of available options, the name of the movie the video that was just played comes from. If they select correctly, they will be awarded 1 'right' point. If they select incorrectly, they will be assigned 1 'wrong' point.

If the user manages to acquire 10 'right' points by the time the game is over, they win the game and will bask in the glory of some sweet victory music. If however, they amass 3 'wrong' points during any point in the game, they will writhe in the agony that is being taunted by a faceless voice.

What features did it include?:

Some features included are video and audio element playback, radio button disabling to prevent answer changes, and audio swapping based on win and loss conditions.

Were there any particular pain points or unsolved problems you had to manage? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.):

Took me a while to figure out what needed to be done and in what order but once I did, I was off to the races. Unfortunately, as of this moment, I still have a lot of DRY code that I am trying to refactor.

Is there any other information you think might help us understand what you've built?:

Not at the moment.

List the technologies used: CSS, HTML, JAVASCRIPT

Describe the approach taken:

I made a click counter and made each iteration of the click counter trigger a number of things including swapping out my videos, question divs and audio files.

In addition, you can use the README to provide any other useful information about your app:

The only other thing to add is I'd like to be able to refactor the code to be much shorter and maybe someday make it so that the order in which the videos appear changes everytime the game is played while still being tied to a specific question and answer set.
